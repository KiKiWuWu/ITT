What is random noise?Random noise is defined as a series of acoustic or electrical signals that contain all varieties of frequencies. There are different types of noise: white, grey and pink for example. In context of DSP random noise should be reduced by applying divers filter types to achieve a better clarity of the logged signal.What does a low-pass filter do in general?Characteristically a low-pass filter lets low-frequency signals through, but not high-frequency signals. The level of Hz the low-pass filter begins to attenuate the content is set by the cutoff frequency. So for example a cutoff frequency of 50Hz will affect all frequencies of a sine wave that are above 50Hz, but not the ones below the limit.Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?A moving average filter calculates a series of averages in a fixed window that moves along the axis of radiants. It can help smoothen the data and filters the high-frequency signals. Therefor it can be specified as a low-pass filter.Unfortunately it only removes a small amount of high-frequency signals.
